# Wine Cellar Application #

This is sample CRUD application for a wine cellar company. The application is old, and was developed long ago. All that remains is the sample wine table, and some started data from an sql dump. Your challenge is to update this app using angular.

## Application Requirements
- The application should allow for basic CRUD functionality. You should be able to create a wine, pull up a wine or collection of all wine in the cellar, and update and delete wines. Hint: you will require an API for this. I suggest using Mongoose and MongoDB. However, I have included an sql dump that you can recreate in MySql if you wish. If you decide to do your api using mysql, you will of course need to use PHP to do it. The frontend has to be in angular. An api directory has been provided for this purpose.

- An image called cellar2.jpg has been included as a version of how the application might look. 

- Remember that at startup, there may be no wines in the cellar, so you must provide a way for the user to start entering wine in the cellar. Hint: you will need a wine entry button that opens up a wine entry form.

- Some css has been provided as well as an index.html page to get you started. There are pics of the wine bottles in the pics folders that correspond to the data in the .sql file.
